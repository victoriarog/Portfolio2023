Project initially seemed to gain a lot of attention and gathered quite a decent audinece on social media. However due to the events of 2021-2022 in the world and the general loss of trust into the NFT market, when launched to selling on the OpenSea - it did not go as planned as it gathered less funds than anticipated. Unfortunately as of now the project remains frozen and inactive with hopes to bring it back, shall the chance to do so arise. "
